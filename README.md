# Challenge - 20
## React Portfolio

- For this week's challenge, I was tasked with using React to create a responsive SPA for my personal portfolio website. I utilized JSX syntax, react components and conditional rendering to generate a rough draft of what I would like to see for my website.

## User Story

- AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples

## Weekly Reflection
---

- This week was very difficult for me. React is incredibly interesting and vast but I feel like I need more time to brush up on my styling and html formatting. I was very slow on this week and I with the project just around the corner, I need to rush even more. I intend to redo this website post bootcamp with more time to watch videos and read up on techniques to help flesh out exactly how I want the site to look. This assignment has humbled me in the sense that I do not have the BEST understanding of vanilla css styling and I need to improve my knowledge as best as I can. Next assignment will incorporate the full MERN stack so I will be knee deep in work. Here's to another week! Almost to the finish line!
